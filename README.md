# Console-Finances
To showcase what I have learnt so far about: Javascript fundementals.

## Aim:
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Built with:
* HTML
* Javascript

## Usage:
To use this Console-Finances, you can review it by opening the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the financial analysis.
